   </ul>

   <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
   <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
   <p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
   <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
     <ul>
      <li>Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users</li>
      <li>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
      <li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>
      <li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
    <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
   </ul>

   <p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
   <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
   <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
    <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
    <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
    <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
    <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
    <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
    <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
    <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
    <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes</li>
    <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
    <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
    </ul>

We have contracts in place with these third parties, which are designed to help protect your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us.

Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third-party websites. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this Privacy Notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>

      <h2>6. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
      <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>
      <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>
      <p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>
      <p>To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a "sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section "DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?"</p>
      <p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>
      <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong><br>

      <h2>7. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
      <p><strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</p>
      <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
      <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

      <h2>8. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>
      <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</p>
      <p>Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored by, and processed by us in our facilities and in the facilities of the third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?" above), in the United States, and other countries.</p>
      <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.</p>
      <p><strong>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</strong></p>
      <p>We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>

      <h2>9. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
      <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
      <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

      <h2>10. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
      <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
      <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our measures and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

      <h2>11. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
      <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
      <p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at officialreceiptsplitter@gmail.com.</p>

      <h2>12. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
      <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>
      <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
      <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
      <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>
      <p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>
      <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
      <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
      <p><strong>Account Information</strong><br>
      If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
      <ul>
        <li>Contact us using the contact information provided: officialreceiptsplitter@gmail.com</li>
      </ul>
      Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. You may also opt out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services.</p>
      <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at officialreceiptsplitter@gmail.com.</p>
        <h2>13. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
  <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
  <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
