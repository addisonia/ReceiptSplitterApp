# Receipt Splitter App

The revolutionary app designed off the [receiptsplitter.org](https://receiptsplitter.org) website that allows users to create/edit/share receipts with friends.

[Available on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.receiptsplitter.app&hl=en_US)

## How to Use

### Splitting a Bill

This is the main screen, which you can get to by tapping "Start Splitting."

1.  **Name Your Receipt:** Tap the "My receipt" title to name your receipt.
2.  **Add Buyers & Tax:** Use the input boxes to add the names of people splitting the bill and the total tax.
3.  **Add Items:** Add each item's name and price.
4.  **Assign Items:** As you add items, they appear in the table at the bottom. Here you can assign items to buyers using the checkboxes. By default, when you add an item everyone is marked for that item. You can adjust the quantity if you want to duplicate that item a given number of times. The "Cost per Buyer" section updates automatically with any changes.

You can also tap the **Settings** gear ⚙️ to change themes or to toggle the "Split Tax Evenly" option (which divides tax based on each person's subtotal instead of evenly). In this image below on the left, the color theme was changed to the Random Colors option (I highly recommend not using this theme and I regret making it).

### Account

* To sign in or create an account on the app, tap the **"User Icon"** in the top Navigation Bar (second icon to the left).
* You will then be prompted to sign in with Google. For simplicity and security reasons this is the only sign in option at the moment.
* If the sign in is successful, you should see a green dot next to your user icon.
* Once signed in, the app will auto-generate a username for your account. You can change this if you'd like by tapping your user icon and then tapping on your username and editing the username. You can either hit enter on your keypad or tap anywhere off the screen to save your edits.
* You cannot have a username that is already being used by another user, the app will not save the changes otherwise. Once your username is changed, any messages that you sent in the chatrooms will be updated to show your new username.
* **NOTE** Account data is seamlessly synced between the app and website, so you can save a receipt on the website and import that same receipt into your app if you are signed into the same account!

### Saving & Managing Receipts

You must be signed in to save and import receipts.

* Tap the **"Save"** button on the Split screen to save a receipt to your account.
* Data entered on the Split Page is automatically saved cached on your local storage for convenience, so you can leave the Split Page or the app and come back to edit it later.
* To clear the data, tap the **"Reset"** button twice.  
* Access all your past receipts from the **"Receipts"** page by tapping the receipt icon in the top right of the home screen.
* On the Receipts page, you can see all your saved bills, sorted by date. Tap the trash can icon 🗑️ to delete old receipts, or tap the arrow ▼ to see a detailed breakdown of each receipt.

### Friends & Chatrooms

The app includes a social network system for easy sharing.

* **Add Friends:** Swipe right from the Home Screen to go the Profile/Friends screen and tap the user icon in the top left to access the Friends page. You can search for any user on the app (that has signed in) by username and manage friend requests. You can also add friends by **long-pressing a message and tapping "Add Friend."** 
* **Create Group Chats:** You can create group chats with two or more of your friends. Tap the Plus Sign Icon in the top right of the chat screen to access the Create Group Chats page. Select the friends you want for your new group. 
* **Chat:** You can DM your friends or talk in group chats. **Long-press a message and tap "Message"** to directly message a user. You can also send messages in the global chat with all other users (note: to reduce spam, you currently cannot send receipts in global chat). **DO NOT send malicious messages or hate-speech or you will be reported and removed from the app**.

### Share & Import Receipts

This is a really cool and useful feature where you can upload any saved reciepts into a group chat or direct message with other users on the app (who are added as friends).

* While in a group chat or DM, tap the receipt icon (📄) in the bottom left.
* This will open your list of saved receipts. Tap one to upload and share it.
* The receipt will be sent as a custom receipt message in the chat.
* Anyone else in the chat can **long-press that message and tap "Import Receipt."** 
* The app will automatically load that *entire receipt* (items, prices, and all) onto their app for them to edit. They can then save it to their own account and re-upload it with any changes as well.
